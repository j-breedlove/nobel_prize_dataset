# Nobel Prize Dataset Analysis

This project provides an analysis of the Nobel Prize dataset using Python. It aims to uncover patterns and insights about Nobel laureates and the prizes they've won.

## Getting Started

To start with this project, clone the repository, install the requirements, and run the Jupyter notebook.

### Prerequisites

The project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Install the prerequisites using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

2. Install Jupyter Notebook:

```
pip install notebook
```

3. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/nobel_prize_dataset.git
```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook nobel_prize_dataset.ipynb
```

## Usage

The notebook starts with importing the necessary Python libraries, followed by loading the dataset. The dataset `nobel_prize_dataset.csv` should be in a `data` folder in the same directory as the notebook.

The analysis is presented in a structured manner, with markdown cells providing context and explanations for the corresponding code cells.
